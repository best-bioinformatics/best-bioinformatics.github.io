How to use ‘awk’ to print columns from a text file (in any order).



{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}


Printing columns of information from Unix text files is easy, especially using commands like awk, perl, and more recently, ruby. This short tutorial shows my old-school awk way of doing this.

awk column printing examples
Suppose you have a file named foo with contents like this:

1 2 3
a b c
You can easily use awk to print columns of information from this file. Here are a few examples that show how to print the data columns from the file:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat foo

1 2 3
a b c

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight bash %}
$ awk '{ print $1 }' foo

1
a

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight bash %}
$ awk '{ print $2 }' foo

2
b

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
$ awk '{ print $1, $3 }' foo

1 3
a c

{% endhighlight %}
As you can see, with awk you can print any column you want, and can print the columns in any order you want.

While all of these examples show awk working directly on a file, it can also read its input from a Unix pipeline, like this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat foo | awk '{ print $3, $1 }'

3 1
c a

{% endhighlight %}
awk is a great tool for rearranging columns in Unix text file output.


 If tab delimited table will be created, you can use.
{% highlight bash %}
$ awk -F '\t' '{ print $1, $3 }' fo

{% endhighlight %}

 The following command will help print tab delimited output in awk

{% highlight bash %}
awk -v OFS="\t" '{ print $1,$2,$2,$4,$5 }' XX.vcf > XX.avinput

{% endhighlight %}
 create any combination of delimiters we want for the txt files.

{% highlight bash %}
awk -v OFS='' '{print $1,"\t",$2,"\t",$3,"\t",$4,"|",$5,"|",$6,"|",$7,"|",$8}' Hs_EPDnew_006_hg19.bed > EPDnew_hg19.bed

for fl in *.bed; 
do echo $fl; 
awk -v OFS='' '{print $1,"\t",$2,"\t",$3,"\t",$4,"|",$5,"|",$6}' $fl > /n/anotherfolder/LAB/$fl; 
done;

{% endhighlight %}
